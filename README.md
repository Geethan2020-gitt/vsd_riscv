The program is based on the RISC-V architecture and uses open-source tools to teach people about VLSI chip design and RISC-V. The instructor for this internship is Kunal Ghosh Sir.

<summary><b>Task 1:</b> C based and RISC-V based programs for sum of first n numbers</summary>   
<br>

C based
------------------------------------------

Install leafpad editor 

*Use the following command for installing leafpad*
```
sudo apt install leafpad
```
Now we need to write a program in c for sum of 1 to n numbers, and save the file as "sum1ton.c"

Now after we compile this and run using the commands :

```
gcc sum1ton.c
./a.out
```
The output of the c code is :

RISC-V based
------------------------------------------

We can view the sum code using the following command :
```
cat sum1ton.c
```
The terminal output of the above the commad :
